Constituent Connect

**Problem:** Constituent Connect is a solution to a problem I once encountered while interning on Capitol Hill. Interns took numerous calls from constituents every day, wrote down the call, and then proceded to throw their notes away. Valuable data was being collected but never reaching the Congressman's desk. 

**Solution:** Constituent Connect seeks to remedy this problem by providing a dashboard to record calls, search bills for more accurate information, collect caller details, and then display this information on a reports page. As a constituent, your voice is being heard. As a congressman, you have realtime data that conveys constituent sentiment and provides a solid base of contacts who are most politically active in the community.

**Time building app:** 1 week

**Client:** My final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course

**Technologies:**

+ Rails 4.1.6
+ Ruby 2.1.2
+ Angular.js
+ JavaScript
+ JQuery 2.1.1
+ PostgresSQL Database
+ Sunlight Foundation, Congress API
+ Gems:
  + Devise
  + ChartKick
  + Faker
  + Angular-rails
  + 12_factor
  
**Going Forward:**

Going forward, I would like this application to have a search query that populates as the user (intern) types so that he or she can more accurately find a bill that the caller is referring to. I would also like to incorporate more of Sunlight Foundation's APIs in order to compare realtime data on the Hill to realtime call data.
